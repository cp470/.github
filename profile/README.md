# Course Project

## Project Requirements (Group Project of five students – 30%)

Students can develop an app of their choice. However, students need the instructor’s approval before starting to develop the app.  

- The project requires the development of a **native mobile app** created using:
  - Java programming language  
  - Android Studio IDE  
- Projects developed with **third-party frameworks** and then converted into Android apps will **not be graded**.  
- This is a **group project** consisting of 5 members:
  - Each member is responsible for a portion of the project
  - The integrated work of all members should result in a complete app  
- You may find inspiration for your project from:  
  - [113 Brilliant Mobile App Ideas 2023 For Your Next Business Startup](sagipl.com)

The group project requires you to apply the knowledge gained from this course to develop an application for an Android device.  

You are encouraged to **exceed the requirements** for a higher grade.  
> Projects that incorporate **machine learning** typically receive higher marks.
